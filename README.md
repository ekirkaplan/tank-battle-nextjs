## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Network Efficiency
- **Delta compression** reduces network traffic by ~70%
- **Spatial partitioning** enables O(1) collision detection
- **Client-side prediction** with server reconciliation
- **Optimized packet structure** for minimal bandwidth usage

### Memory Management
- **Object pooling** for frequently created/destroyed objects
- **Viewport culling** renders only visible game elements
- **Garbage collection optimization** through smart resource management
- **Connection pooling** for database operations

### Visual Performance
- **Particle system** for explosions and visual effects
- **Screen shake effects** with intensity-based feedback
- **Floating damage numbers** with smooth animations
- **Efficient canvas rendering** with proper frame timing

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MongoDB database (local or cloud)
- Git for version control

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd tank-battle-nextjs

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
```

### Environment Variables
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/tank-battle
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Development
```bash
# Start both Next.js and Socket.IO servers concurrently
npm run dev

# Or start servers individually:
npm run dev:next     # Next.js on port 3000
npm run dev:socket   # Socket.IO on port 3001
```

### Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production servers
npm start

# Or start individually:
npm run start:next   # Production Next.js server
npm run start:socket # Production Socket.IO server
```

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Combat System
- **Base tank stats**: 100 HP, 3 speed, 20 damage
- **Weapon cooldown**: 500ms base, modified by attack speed
- **Health regeneration**: Passive healing based on regeneration attribute
- **Damage calculation**: Base damage + attribute modifiers

### Power-Up Types
- **Health Boost** (+50 HP): Instant health recovery
- **Speed Boost** (2x speed, 10s): Enhanced movement speed
- **Damage Boost** (2x damage, 15s): Increased projectile damage
- **Rapid Fire** (0.5x cooldown, 10s): Faster shooting rate
- **Shield** (50% damage reduction, 20s): Defensive enhancement

### Attribute System
Players gain 2 attribute points per level to customize their tanks:
- **Health**: +10 maximum HP per point
- **Speed**: +3% movement speed per point
- **Damage**: +5 projectile damage per point
- **Regeneration**: +0.5 HP/second passive healing per point
- **Attack Speed**: -5% weapon cooldown per point

### Experience & Leveling
- **Kills**: 50 XP per enemy elimination
- **Damage dealt**: 0.5 XP per damage point
- **Score points**: 10 XP per score earned
- **Level requirements**: Exponential growth (base 100 XP × 1.5^(level-1))

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint         # ESLint code analysis
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking
npm test             # Run test suite
```

### Testing
- **Unit tests** for game logic components
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Performance tests** for game loop optimization
- **Jest configuration** with TypeScript support
